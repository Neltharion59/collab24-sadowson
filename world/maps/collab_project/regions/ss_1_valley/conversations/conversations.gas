I came here seeking my family's heraldric sword, said to be powerful and well crafted. It was hidden in our ancient family tomb many years ago by my rather spiteful grandfather.
My rather crude blade was destroyed as I fought my way into the safety of this castle from the rumbling undead outside. Lady Athena is forbidding anyone without weapons to leave and I have no coin to buy a new blade. If you can help me acquire my family blade then I shall gladly aid you on your quest.";
