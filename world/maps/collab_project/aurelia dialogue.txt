////////////////////////

Aurelia is a healer who specialises in making healing potions and looking after the sick and wounded. Although her primary job is as a healer, she also engages in trade with travellers that are passing through.
She has a general disdain for warriors - melee users - who tend to stick their sword in anything they dont like, and she has a great level of respect for users of healing magic.


Her dialogue is broken up into two categories - start-of-game and end-game, where her dialogue changes based off the main quest state. Each ////// is a seperation of dialogue for recording.

That a mage versed in the art of combat magic has braved the undead from whence they came and protected our home is one worthy of singing high praises. I would be most honoured to trade with you traveller. What spells and potions do you require?

That a warrior of your calibre was able to brave the undead head on is worthy of note. Though I am usually apprehensive of the boneheaded adventurers swinging their sword at anything that moves, I must admit that you seem a cut above the rest. You're pack is probably empty and in need of some more potions. Can I help you with that?

//////

The warrior returning! What potions can I help you with?
