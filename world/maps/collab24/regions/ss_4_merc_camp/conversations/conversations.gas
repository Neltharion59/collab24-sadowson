That's a bit bold if you ask me.
Still, we'll be camped here for a while longer. The lads have been pulling all sorts of treasure from the crypts but dirtying myself isn't really my thing. But I'd be *glad* to trade a few things with you... Got your purse?";

To be honest, the captain sorta had it coming. If you hadn't challenged him, someone else would have. He's been sending us down into some ancient tomb to try and find treasure, but there's just junk in there!
I'm guessing you'll be wanting his shiny purple crystal huh?";

Some of the boys took it into the crypt to see if it'd help ward off the undead so we could loot the place better.
