About me:

I've been making mods for Dungeon Siege practically since the Siege Editor was first released back in the early 2000's, though my skills have significantly progressed since then! This has been a fun diversion from my current projects which I'm hoping to share more of in the future.

About my contribution:
The hero has entered a dark valley with an even darker secret. The undead are restless and hostile mercenaries have been seen roaming around, a curious situation for an otherwise normally sleepy place. Lady Athena in her home of Larissa is seeking a solution to the problem and perhaps you are the answer?
Shattered Crossings is a story that I've had on paper for a good long while now. Players only interested in hacking and slashing their way through enemies should find no trouble doing so, meanwhile other players that have a deeply vested interest in a storyline with hidden secrets to uncover should find a good story that unfolds before them.
